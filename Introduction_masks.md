Press Release

With the objective of contributing to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, members of the student council of Ecole Polytechnique - class of 1981 (Kès 81)  performed an analysis of the rate of expansion of the disease in several countries in relation to the use of protective masks. This analysis is not meant as a substitute to in-depth scientific studies but its results are significant enough to be put forward [1].
Said analysis and following recommendations are the signatories' only and do not reflect the position of the class of 1981 nor of any of its representative entities. Its vocation is to be completed and amended following an open-source model.

Countries where the use of protective masks is prevalent due to either cultural or regulatory context, have not experienced exponential pandemic growth even though they have different policies in terms of tests, confinement or border control, or even different health systems or hygiene practices.

The analysis was based on the comparison between the development rate of the epidemic in these countries compared to a calculation based on the observed use of masks and published efficiency of protective masks.

The analysis shows that the simulations are close to the observed data and clearly establishes a correlation. Given the magnitude of the discrepancy for the rate of replication between countries promoting the use of masks (circa 1) and the others (circa 3) it is highly likely that there is an underlying causal link. This hypothesis is shared by numerous specialists in Asia, notably in China and South Korea.

The hypothesis that generalised use of protective masks (or any means of limiting propagation via aerosol or hand-to-face contact) significantly slows down the epidemic seems therefore extremely likely. Its contribution to the control of pandemic propagation could be of the same magnitude as confinement. The main objective of the systematic use of masks is not only to protect the wearer (as is the case for medical personnel) but to reduce the replication rate R0 to bring it from 3 to circa 1.

We therefore recommend to launch the three following measures as soon as possible:
1. Promote then make compulsory the use of protective masks in public spaces, be it homemade masks while the availability of certified products remains insufficient.
2. Invest in local manufacturing of protective masks following the example set by China in mobilising their industry
3. Confirm by an in-depth scientific studies the above conclusions so as to target the most efficient measures.
