#### Thailand
One of the most visited countries in the world, Thailand closed their borders early on and the use of masks is high. Only 5 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date. We will not study this country in the present paper but it is notable that all countries with prevalent use of protective masks see effective results.

#### Taiwan
Taiwan is considered a role model by several countries. Schools were quick to reopen with a high level of control and the number of cases remains limited. Borders were also closed early on. Despite the close ties with the Republic of China, only 300 cases and 2 deaths were recorded. Army contributed to the production of masks, currently at 10 millions per day for a population of 23 million. Distribution is based on the local Social Security ID so as to prevent wrongdoings. Weekly allocation is 3 masks per adult and 5 per child.

#### Czech Republic
The policy adopted by the Czech Republic is singular in Europe. On 18 March, the government edicted that a mask or scarf should be worn in any public space.  
Many Czechs ar now wearing a mask in public, which seemed to have been the case even before the government's instructions.  
Following public figures and influencers, Czech had started to manufacture protective masks at home en masse, and a grassroots movement "masks4all" turned the use of masks into a national cause.  
The government followed public opinion. To demonstrate their commitment, cabinet ministers now wear masks when addressing people on TV. In parallel, testing was ramped up, 150,000 quick tests having been ordered from China. Even if it is still early to assess the impact of these homemade masks, the number of cases is stable and only 9 deaths have been recorded, far from the exponential development seen in neighbouring Germany and Austria. Replication rate is likely to be hovering around 1 which would explain the quali-linear (as opposed to exponential) spread of the disease.

### II Theoretical calculation
Our hypothesis are based on the various types of masks. In the absence of accurate data in the case of COVID-19 we use studies performed by the University of Cambridge, as presented and completed on the website of social enterprise Smart Air (smartairfilters.com).  
Hypothesis H1 assumes an 80% efficiency outwards and 30% inwards (surgical mask, with reduction in inward flow of one third of the cases, corresponding to hand-to-mouth contact), H2 assumes a 60% efficiency both inwards and outwards, corresponding to an average of various mask types. H3 assumes homemade masks with low efficiency: 50% outwards, 20% inwards.  
Assuming generalised use (100%) leads to a Ro at 0.5 (similar to China) for H1 and H2 and 1.2 (similar to Czech Republic) for H3.  
Assuming 60% use of H1 and H2 masks plus 10% of H3 masks leads to a rate circa 1.2 (comparable to Japan).  
Finally assuming 80% use of either H1 or H2 masks gives a Ro circa 0.8 (South Korea).   
This simple calculation is performed as follows (example of 80% use and outwards inwards efficiency ratios Eo and Ei).  
Interactions between virus carriers and healthy subjects:
+ 20% x 20% =  4% (unprotected to unprotected) x Ro
+ 80% x 20% = 16% (protected to unprotected)   x Ro x (1-Eo)
+ 20% x 80% = 16% (unprotected to protected)   x Ro x (1-Ei)
+ 80% x 80% = 64% (protected to protected)     x Ro x (1-Eo) x (1-Ei)

### III Comparison with empirical evidence
Our theoretical calculations are in line with the empirical observation of the spread of the disease in countries where mask use is either enforced (China, Czech Republic) or culturally ingrained (Japan, South Korea). The same calculation would apply to Taiwan, Hong Kong or Thailand with similar results. There are two merits in having a low replication rate: firstly, a R close to 1 leads to a quasi-linear growth of the epidemic, buying time for governments to adust measures balancing public safety, the level of stress to the health system and the preservation of the economy.  
Also, the level of herd immunity Ti (the share of the population that needs to be immune for the number of new cases to start decreasing) is lower the closer Ro gets to 1, following the formula Ti = 1 - 1/R. This share is 67% for R = 3, 40% for R = 1.7,  10% for R = 1.1. A low R therefore both slows the spread of the disease and brings forward the end of the epidemic.  
Other measures such as the closing of schools and the implementation of preventive gestures are common to all countries. Confinement becomes necessary when the situation gets out of control, which quickly happens with daily growth rates of 33% as originally observed in Wuhan and Hubei province, now in Europe. Closing borders for countries where the epidemic is contained becomes necessary when all or  new cases are imported as is now the case in China or Japan. In the long run, one could envision the emergence of areas of free circulation restricted to countries having managed, thanks partially to the use of masks, to eradicate the virus.  
As we considered countries differing widely in terms of density, hygienic and sanitary practices, health prevention culture, prevalence of tests, health or transport density and infrastructure, the observed correlation between the use of protective masks and the replication rate leaves little doubt on the first-order impact of this policy. If correlation does not always imply causality, the magnitude of the discrepancy between countries using masks or not is compelling.
