## Fact-based qualitative analysis of the impact of using protective masks in the COVID-19 crisis

*In this paper, we will refer to protective masks and similar facial protection as simply “masks”*

### Preliminary statement
The purpose of this document is to highlight the critical elements contributing to reduce the outbreak of the virus, focusing on two levers:

-	**The systematic use of masks, even homemade**
-	**The immediate mass production of high quality masks** 

### Introduction and framework of the analysis
This summarised document does not intend to replace an in-depth study: its objective is to demonstrate critical factors and correlations in both a qualitative/fact-based and reasonably quantified manner.
All references given at the end of the document have established the basis for this analysis.

This analysis was conducted with a two-pronged approach:
- An empirical approach: measuring or estimating the Ro (basic replication rate) of the epidemics in different countries with different practices regarding the use of masks, based on publicly available data.
- A bottom-up calculation of a theoretical Ro based on the level of use of masks in different countries. We measured or had measured the actual share of mask use in different locations (street, shops, subway) and factored in the efficiency of different types of masks as published in the scientific literature according to laboratory tests.  

To our knowledge, it is the only analysis comparing these 2 elements, establishing a tentative yet convincing evidence of correlation between the use of masks and the reduction of the Ro ratio.

We made 4 assumptions:

1.	The most sophisticated masks (FFP2) are reserved for medical practitioners, nurses and employees in contact with infected patients. These masks aim at protecting those individuals. Our study covers 2 other types of masks: basic 3-ply masks (usually found in pharmacies, drugstores or online) and homemade fabric masks.  

2.	The Ro of the disease is around 3.0 in countries without countermeasures. It means that on average one infected person will directly transmit the virus to 3 other people (seasonal influenza Ro is around 1.1). The cumulated number of cases and deaths follow an exponential curve of around 33% increase per day or a multiplication by a factor 3 every 4 days. We assume that over a long period the recorded number of cases and deaths country by country reflects their actual evolution, even though the way of conducting tests does vary between countries. In a given country, discrepancies in the way of collecting and computing data are supposed to be marginal in the long run.

3.	The filtration power of masks as measured in laboratory reflects the reduction in emission and reception of droplets. There is no specific data regarding COVID-19 virus specifically. We have taken 3 couples or emission/reception: namely 80/30, 60/60, and 50/20. This data is based on 3 types of assumed efficiency as found in reports: filtration power being at and above 50% for basic one layer cotton masks made home, at 60 or 80% for  industrial 3fold masks. On the reception side, literature gives hypotheses ranging from a limited protection only to an efficiency similar to the emission efficiency. There are indeed 3 ways of catching virus: by direct droplets reaching the face, by indirect contact by hand as the virus can survive from 3 hours on fabrics to 3 days on metal, and through aerosol with droplets of less than 5 microns staying in suspension in the air during several hours. There is still a lot uncertainty of how those three routes are actually causing contamination and how masks are effectively protecting those who wear them, hence the different assumptions we made. 

4.	We assume that the use of  masks does not influence the way all other measures of hygiene and social distancing are applied.


### I Empirical Approach

#### China
Of the 3,295 deaths that have been officially recorded on the 28th of March, 3,174 were in the Hubei province, the capital city of which is Wuhan with only 121 in the rest of the country. In this province, 40 million people were in total confinement for 2 months, the army ensuring compliance. 42,000 health personnel, doctors and nurses were sent from all over the country. In the rest of China, a 4 weeks partial confinement was put in place. Schools and many shops were closed. In parallel China increased its production of masks by a factor 15 (from 10 to 150 million per day) in a month mobilising its entire manufacturing infrastructure; for example, the car maker BYD, in just 4 weeks and starting from scratch ended up producing 5 million masks every day. Eventually, wearing a mask in public spaces became mandatory. In March, after this measure was put in place, the number of cases reduced dramatically and has since almost disappeared. Locally transmitted cases have disappeared. Economy is restarting, schools are gradually reopening and wearing a mask in public and at work remains an obligation. We deduct from this decrease that Ro during March was materially below 1.

#### South Korea
After a crisis and a peak of cases (mainly due to a gathering in a religious sect in Daegu, caused by a “super spreader” end of February), the outbreak is totally under control. The number of new cases and daily deaths is decreasing to a level among the lowest in the world. On the 28th of March the death toll was 139, reaching  177 on the 4th of April. From a local source, 75% of people in the street of Seoul were wearing masks, 90% in shops, and 95% in the subway. Today, the government distributes 2 masks per week per person. South Korea has also engaged in a very aggressive testing policy especially among all the members of the sect and their acquaintances. Ro can be estimated slightly below 1.

#### Japan
Japan was one of the first countries affected - on average Chinese tourists in Japan account for 1 million per month. The first case, supposedly brought by a tourist from Wuhan, happened on the 15th of January. From late January, the percentage of Japanese wearing masks started to increase.  Observed use rate was about 60% in the street, 80% in shops and 90% in public transportation. During March, with a stabilised number of cases, this percentage gradually decreased. The combination of this relaxation and of the inflow of repatriated Japanese carriers, especially from Europe resulted in an increase of cases from mid-March. The government threatened additional measures and called for increased social distancing. The percentage of people wearing masks increased again and was recently measured at 80% in the streets and close to 90% in supermarkets. In April, the government will send a reusable and washable mask to all Japanese to compensate for the shortage of single-use masks. The number of available masks was 600 million in March and will surpass 700 million in April. From the evolution of the number of cases and deaths, we estimate the R0 was close to 1.1 and reaches now 1.4, most cases being located in Tokyo and its area. We will monitor its evolution after recent strengthening of social distancing and the increase is the mask use rate. In total, the number of deaths on the 28th of March was around 50 and was still less than 80 on the 4th of April, which is remarkable for a country counting the oldest population in the world and one of the densest urban areas. By comparison, the death ratio is 0.6 per one million inhabitants in Japan, 200 times smaller than France.

#### Thailand
One of the most visited countries in the world, Thailand closed their borders early on and the use of masks is high. Only 5 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date. We will not study this country in the present paper but it is notable that all countries with prevalent use of protective masks see effective results.

#### Taiwan
Taiwan is considered a role model by several countries. Schools were quick to reopen with a high level of control and the number of cases remains limited. Borders were also closed early on. Despite the close ties with the Republic of China, only 300 cases and 2 deaths were recorded. Army contributed to the production of masks, currently at 10 millions per day for a population of 23 million. Distribution is based on the local Social Security ID so as to prevent wrongdoings. Weekly allocation is 3 masks per adult and 5 per child.

#### Czech Republic
The policy adopted by the Czech Republic is singular in Europe. On 18 March, the government edicted that a mask or scarf should be worn in any public space.  
Many Czechs ar now wearing a mask in public, which seemed to have been the case even before the government's instructions.  
Following public figures and influencers, Czech had started to manufacture protective masks at home en masse, and a grassroots movement "masks4all" turned the use of masks into a national cause.  
The government followed public opinion. To demonstrate their commitment, cabinet ministers now wear masks when addressing people on TV. In parallel, testing was ramped up, 150,000 quick tests having been ordered from China. Even if it is still early to assess the impact of these homemade masks, the number of cases is stable and only 9 deaths have been recorded, far from the exponential development seen in neighbouring Germany and Austria. Replication rate is likely to be hovering around 1 which would explain the quali-linear (as opposed to exponential) spread of the disease.

### II Bottom-up Calculation
Our hypotheses are based on the performance of the various types of masks. In the absence of accurate data in the case of COVID-19 we used studies performed by the University of Cambridge, as presented and completed on the website of social enterprise Smart Air (smartairfilters.com).  
Hypothesis H1 assumes an 80% efficiency outwards and 30% inwards (surgical mask, with reduction in inward flow of one third of the cases, corresponding to hand-to-mouth contact), H2 assumes a 60% efficiency both inwards and outwards, corresponding to an average of various mask types. H3 assumes homemade masks with low efficiency: 50% outwards, 20% inwards.  
Assuming generalised use (100%) leads to a Ro at 0.5 (similar to China) for H1 and H2 and 1.2 (similar to Czech Republic) for H3.  
Assuming 60% use of H1 and H2 masks plus 10% of H3 masks leads to a rate circa 1.2 (comparable to Japan).  
Finally assuming 80% use of either H1 or H2 masks gives a Ro circa 0.8 (South Korea).   
This simple calculation is performed as follows (example of 80% use and outwards inwards efficiency ratios Eo and Ei).  
Interactions between virus carriers and healthy subjects:
>20% x 20% =  4% (unprotected to unprotected) x Ro  
80% x 20% = 16% (protected to unprotected)   x Ro x (1-Eo)  
20% x 80% = 16% (unprotected to protected)   x Ro x (1-Ei)  
80% x 80% = 64% (protected to protected)     x Ro x (1-Eo) x (1-Ei)  

### III Comparison with empirical evidence
Our theoretical calculations are in line with the empirical observation of the spread of the disease in countries where mask use is either enforced (China, Czech Republic) or culturally ingrained (Japan, South Korea). The same calculation would apply to Taiwan, Hong Kong or Thailand with similar results. There are two merits in having a low replication rate: firstly, a Ro close to 1 leads to a quasi-linear growth of the epidemic, buying time for governments to adust measures balancing public safety, the level of stress to the health system and the preservation of the economy.  
Also, the level of herd immunity Ti (the share of the population that needs to be immune for the number of new cases to start decreasing) is lower the closer Ro gets to 1, following the formula Ti = 1 - 1/Ro. This share is 67% for Ro = 3, 40% for Ro = 1.7,  10% for Ro = 1.1. A low Ro therefore both slows the spread of the disease and brings forward the end of the epidemic.  
Other measures such as the closing of schools and the implementation of preventive gestures are common to all countries. Confinement becomes necessary when the situation gets out of control, which quickly happens with daily growth rates of 33% as originally observed in Wuhan and Hubei province, now in Europe. Closing borders for countries where the epidemic is contained becomes necessary when all or  new cases are imported as is now the case in China or Japan. In the long run, one could envision the emergence of areas of free circulation restricted to countries having managed, thanks partially to the use of masks, to eradicate the virus.  
As we considered countries differing widely in terms of density, hygienic and sanitary practices, health prevention culture, prevalence of tests, health or transport density and infrastructure, the observed correlation between the use of protective masks and the replication rate leaves little doubt on the first-order impact of this policy. If correlation does not always imply causality, the magnitude of the discrepancy between countries using masks or not is compelling.

### IV Conclusions and recommendations

In the case of France, there is a  short term deficit of enough throw-away or certified masks, and their production can only be gradual. A mandate to wear homemade masks to restart the economy at the end of the confinement period looks therefore realistic.  The restart would be made progressively to keep Ro below 1.  Strict confinement would continue for those most at risk while those going back to work would have to wear a mask. With the help of homemade masks, Ro would initially be around 1.2 (see section), and progressively decrease towards 0.5 as more effective masks become available and a larger part of the population becomes immune, effectively ending the pandemic, as observed in China.  As long as an effective vaccine is not made widely available, it would be prudent to maintain the obligatiion to wear masks in public places so as to avoid a relapse (“overshoot”).
